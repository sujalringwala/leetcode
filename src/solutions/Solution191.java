/**
 * 191. Number of 1 Bits

 * Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of
 * '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).
 *
 * For example, the 32-bit integer ’11' has binary representation
 * 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.
